# Number Guessing Game
## Description
This is a simple terminal-based number guessing game written in Python. The player is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. Depending on the user's guess, the game will provide feedback such as "Too high" or "Too low". The game tracks the number of turns remaining and ends when the player either guesses the correct number or runs out of turns. Additionally, there are two difficulty levels available: easy mode with 10 guesses and hard mode with only 5 guesses.
